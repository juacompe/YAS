YAS, Yet Another Stub
===
Usually, we use `mock` library for doing mock. There are 2 things we want to do with mock but we can't:
- mock a python dictionary and
- apply a role (DCI) to a mock object.

Ruxo has written a simple Stub class in BBG which is generic enough to be reused in other projects. Before we can find a good place for this stuff to land, I'll just leave it in my repository.

God speed to you,
